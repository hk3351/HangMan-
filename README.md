This C++ code implements the classic game Hangman, where players guess letters of a hidden word within a set number of attempts. It begins by defining constants and declaring functions for letter filling and providing game instructions. Within the main function, a random country name is chosen from an array, and players are prompted to guess letters until they either succeed or exhaust their allotted guesses. If the player correctly guesses the word, a victory message is displayed; otherwise, a loss message reveals the correct word. Overall, the code simulates a basic game of Hangman in the C++ programming language.
